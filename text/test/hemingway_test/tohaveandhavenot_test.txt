You know how it is there early in the morning in Havana with the bums still asleep against the walls of the buildings; before even the ice wagons come by with ice for the bars? Well, we came across the square from the dock to the Pearl of San Francisco Cafe to get coffee and there was only one beggar awake in the square and he was getting a drink out of the fountain. But when we got inside the cafe and sat down, there were the three of them waiting for us. We sat down and one of them came over. Well? he said. I cant do it, I told him. Id like to do it as a favour. But I told you last night I couldnt. You can name your own price. It isnt that. I cant do it. Thats all. The two others had come over and they stood there looking sad. They were nice-looking fellows all right and I would have liked to have done them the favour. A thousand apiece, said the one who spoke good English. Dont make me feel bad, I told him. I tell you true I cant do it. Afterwards, when things are changed, it would mean a good deal to you.   I know it. Im all for you. But I cant do it. Why not? I make my living with the boat. If I lose her I lose my living. With the money you buy another boat. Not in jail. They must have thought I just needed to be argued into it because the one kept on. You would have three thousand dollars and it could mean a great deal to you later. All this will not last, you know. Listen, I said. I dont care who is President here. But I dont carry anything to the States that can talk. . You mean we would talk? one of them who hadnt spoke said. He was angry.
