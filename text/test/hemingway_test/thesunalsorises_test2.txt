A fat man came up. Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley. How do you do? said Brett. Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris? asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elks tooth on his watch-chain. Rather, said Brett. Paris is a fine town all right, said the count. But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London. Oh, yes, said Brett. Enormous. Braddocks called to me from a table. Barnes, he said, have a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row. What about? Something the patronnes daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronnes daughters too. I say it was a row. What finally happened? Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom.
