Here's a random sentence. It's written by me. It has a lot of. Similar sentence lengths. There's nothing special about it. It is consistent. It doesn't talk about a whole lot. I like basketball. There's a basketball game on the television. I like television as well. Isn't it weird that people do that for money? Isn't it weird that we pay them to do that? That's just odd to me.
